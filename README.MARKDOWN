### weibo_web

I decided to make [weibo_spider](https://github.com/SidKwok/weibo-spider) a better program.

It is based on [D3](https://github.com/mbostock/d3),[Django](https://github.com/django/django).

To run this program, some tools you should install first:

Python 2.7.9

D3.js(it's included in the file D3)

urllib2

Django

I'll show you something:

The center circle is who you are extracting, and the circles around the center is her fans.

When the mouse is over the cicle,you are able to watch some of her information, and when you click the circle, you'll be able to get in her homepage.

And when you darg it, it has an incredible effect.

Thanks to D3.
